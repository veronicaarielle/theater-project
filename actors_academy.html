<h1>The Actor's Academy</h1>
<h2>This year on the SAN ELIJO CAMPUS</h2>
<p>The Actor’s Academy is a 5-week midsummer program that runs from the June 13 to July 15.
</p>
<p>
Acceptance to the program is by audition only. These auditions are typically held at the end of March and the end of April. It is suggested that you try to get to the first auditions if possible. A student auditioning in round one has a chance to come and audition again at the later audition if they were not accepted. Approximately 20 new students are accepted each year.</p>

<p>The program consists of four essential courses that teach Voice and Diction, Movement and Mask Work, Text Analysis, Acting, Career Development and Performance.</p>

<p>Classes are 5 days a week, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.- 6:45 p.m. There is a public performance at the end of the term that rehearses nightly and will extend the hours of the Academy in the final week.</p>
