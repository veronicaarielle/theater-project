<!--Overview of programs-->
<h1>Theatre Programs</h1>
<p>The Dramatic Arts program includes theoretical and practical courses in all aspects of theatre. Students take courses to prepare for a transfer major in dramatic arts, for professional training, or to fulfill general education requirements. Performance and technical theatre opportunities are available to both majors and non-majors. Career options include both creative and technical work in the performing arts/entertainment industry, such as live theatre, film, television, and broadcasting; academic research and teaching; and other communications-related fields, such as advertising and public relations.</p>






<!--Degrees and Certificates-->
<h2>Associate in Arts Degree</h2>
<h3>Dramatic Arts</h3>
<p>The Dramatic Arts program offers lower-division preparation for students who plan on transferring to pursue a bachelor's degree in dramatic arts. Students planning to transfer and/or earn this associate degree may also need to complete additional requirements or electives required by the transfer institution, as many CSUs and UCs have unique admissions and preparation-for-the-major requirements. Students should meet with a MiraCosta College counselor to identify required courses and to develop a written plan for their targeted university.</p>

<h3>Associate in Arts in Theatre Arts for Transfer Degree</h3>
<p>Students completing this associate degree will have completed lower-division major preparation requirements for a theatre arts degree, an emphasis or option within a theatre arts degree, or a degree considered similar to theatre arts at a participating California State University (CSU) campus. Following transfer to a participating CSU campus, students will be required to complete no more than 60 units to obtain a bachelor’s degree; however, some CSU campuses accepting this degree may require additional lower-division major preparation. This degree may not be appropriate preparation for students transferring to a non-participating CSU campus or to a university or college that is not part of the CSU system. Students should consult with a MiraCosta counselor for further information regarding the most efficient pathway to transfer as a theatre arts major and to determine which CSU campuses are participating in this program. Career options for those who attain a bachelor’s degree in theatre arts include actor, set designer, stage manager, artist, designer, museum curator, photographer, illustrator, and other related career paths.</p>
